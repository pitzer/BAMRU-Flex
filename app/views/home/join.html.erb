          <h3>About our Members</h3>

          BAMRU members are climbers, skiers, mountaineers and backpackers. Every
          member trains hard across multiple disciplines, and is able to operate
          self-sufficiently in the field for up to 72 hours. We all derive
          considerable satisfaction from helping people who are lost or injured in
          the wilderness.

          <h3>How to join BAMRU</h3>

          <h4>1) Decide if BAMRU is a good Fit for You</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Attend any of our General Meetings, to meet our members and learn
              about our operations.
            <li>Contact our Recruiting Officer, who can answer your questions
              about joining BAMRU
            <li>Guests are sometimes allowed to attend the monthly trainings. The
              purpose of trainings is to teach skills to our Trainee Members, and
              many trainings are not open to guests. Some trainings are open to
              guests by invitation only. People with particularly strong outdoors
              experience, prior SAR experience, or a compelling desire to be of
              service to the community are more likely to be invited to trainings.
          </ul>

          <h4>2) Attend our SAR Basic Training</h4>

          BAMRU offers a search and rescue basic training course in March and
          April. Attending these trainings and the March and April meetings is the
          best way to learn about BAMRU, meet BAMRU members, acquire useful
          search-and-rescue skills, and prepare yourself to apply to join the
          Unit. Completion of the April SAR Basic Training Course, plus attendance
          at one other training and two General Meetings will make you eligible to
          apply for membership.<p><p/>

          <h4>3) Apply to our Trainee Program</h4>

          Before applying to become a trainee, guests must attend at least two
          BAMRU meetings and two trainings. Higher preference is given to people
          who attend the March and April training courses. Qualified applicants
          can fill out and submit the
          <a href="backup_html/apply.html" class="nav1">application form</a> and
          meet with the Board of Directors. We recommend you talk to the Unit
          Leader or a senior member before filling out the application. <p><p/>

          BAMRU is a resource of the San Mateo Sheriff's Office. Joining BAMRU
          entails joining the Sheriff's Volunteer Forces. After being accepted to
          BAMRU, you will have about 60 days to complete and submit a detailed,
          lengthy, time-consuming and intrusive Sheriff's background check form.
          Should the Sheriff's Office in its sole judgement determine that your
          background is unsuitable, you will not be able to be a part of BAMRU.
          Background issues of particular concern include a felony conviction,
          restraining order, or outstanding criminal charge; any such concerns
          should be discussed with the Unit Leader <b>prior</b> to submitting an
          application.

          <h3>Who can participate in BAMRU</h3>

          Search and rescue entails hard physical labor, sleep deprivation, and
          substantial disruption to your schedule. You must have the ability,
          willingness, and flexibility to respond to operational call-outs on
          short notice (sometimes in the middle of the night), as well as commit
          time to monthly trainings and meetings. To perservere as a mountain
          rescue volunteer, you will need the support of your loved ones, and your
          workmates.

          <h4>Required to attend Guest Trainings</h4>

          The minimum requirement to join BAMRU is to be an experienced backpacker
          aged 18 or older, able to plan and execute a multi-day Sierra
          backpacking trip and have it not be a big deal. You have to have good
          physical conditioning to perform well on long days, sometimes with
          little sleep.

          <h4>Required to apply for Trainee Membership</h4>

          We require certification in CPR for the professional rescuer (either
          American Red Cross CPR for the Professional Rescuer or American Heart
          Association Basic Life Support for the Healthcare Provider) and Basic
          First Aid before application to become a Trainee Member.

          <h4>Optional, but Nice-to-have</h4>

          We very much welcome specialized skills, including rock climbing and
          mountaineering, advanced medical training, ham radio, and prior SAR
          experience. We want to continue to strengthen our mountaineering
          capabilities, and are particularly interested in people with glacier
          experience.

          <h3>What can I expect if I join BAMRU?</h3>

          Traineeship involves completion of an extensive skills certification
          checklist. Trainee Members are expected to attend monthly General
          Meetings and Trainings to acquire and practice skills, familiarize
          themselves with team procedures and to build an effective working
          relationship with other members. Trainee members are eligibile to go on
          operations on a case-by-case basis. <p></p>

          Trainees who attend all the trainings and the operations to which they
          are invited can expect promotion within a year. There is a second year
          of advanced training to receive promotion to the level of Technical
          Member in BAMRU and in the Mountain Rescue Association. <p><p/>

          The time commitment to be a BAMRU trainee is large. Trainings are
          typically full weekends. Most trainees find they have to spend
          additional time practicing skills to achieve full mastery. Callouts come
          at inconvenient times and can require you to change or cancel your plans
          on short notice. It is essential that Trainee Members have a life that
          can accomodate these demands. <p><p/>

          BAMRU is not for everyone and there are others ways to be a search and
          rescue volunteer. The San Mateo Sheriff's Office
          <a href="http://www.sanmateosar.org/">SMCSAR</a> contributes to to many
          search and rescue operations and provides other services such as medical
          patrols and traffic and public safety at major events. Every California
          county except San Francisco has a search and rescue team which welcomes
          committed volunteers.

          <h3>If I live outside the Bay Area, how can I get involved in SAR?</h3>

          If you would like to learn about opportunities to contribute to search
          and rescue efforts in your community, contact your county sheriff or
          other local law enforcement agency.
